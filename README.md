# TriviaGame
I created this Adventure Time Trivia game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript/Jquery.
Click the START GAME button to begin.
Answer the questions before the time runs out.
Your correct answers, incorrect answers and timed-out will accrue and show at the end of the questions.
You can then play again by hitting the START GAME button.
Adventure Time was created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network and produced by Frederator Studios.
I hold no license or intellectual property. Just a fan.
These questions were gathered from watching the cartoon and with help from http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Adventure_Time_with_Finn_and_Jake_Wiki
